# TMA285
Asian option difference scheeme

This code has been developed as part of a course project
which in turn is complemented by a written report (see ____.pdf).
One may find it beneficial to read the report in order to 
better grasp the ambiguities of the code.

Prerequisits:
One needs python and matplot lib to run the code.

Start up:
Run
    python3 main.py 

through terminal in order to run a single-iteration simulation
For batch simulation call:

    python3 main.py batch

In doing so the simulation will run over a set of predifined sigmas
and initial stock prices. These are the plotted one at a time, which
means that the current plot needs to be closed in order to progress
with the program.
